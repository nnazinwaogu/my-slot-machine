-Version 1.5.2 Patch Notes-

Updates:
slot_machine_1.5 - 
    bet(...) > removed redundent integer type-casting for currbalance as it is already an int
    ~ casted bet variable to int and stored it in intBet() for better usage

    fruitTupleBuilder(...) > implemented tuples to store the fruits of the slot
    ~ added a tuple builder class for fast construction of fruit variables

    lines(...) > added some comments for more clarity
    ~ added indexing when needed to the resultsX variables as they are tuples

    Reorganized parts of the code base to enhance the organization,
    as in, having all the functions until play(...) first (utilty functions),
    then play(...) functions as the observer/menu object, and lastly main() where the
    program runs  

Need to do: 
    >change balance, bet, betting result (and other?) variables to floats to account for all rational numbers > 0
    >import time to add sleep() functionally to increase realism within simulation
