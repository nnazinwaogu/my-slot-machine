--Version 1.5.1 Patch Notes--

Updates:
README.md - fixed existing typos. Removed an irrelevant sentence 

slot_machine_1.5:   
    bet(...) > created a bet(...) function to separate the betting and spinning logic up
    for more clarity and better flow of logic
    ~removed 2 redundant lines of code within the loop
    ~implemented the spin function call, solely within the bet(...) function for better flow of logic and clarity
    ~updated the input arguements of bet(...) by assigning them to the return of lines(...)
    ~included that the function returns the input arguments to fix the updating issue
    
    lines(...) > removed the continue statements from each if-else condition as the function does not loop anymore
    ~included that the function returns the input arguments to fix the updating issue

    play(...) > updated starting balance and current balance to the return of deposit(...) on various lines
    >removed lines function call from this function
    ~updated the input arguements of play(...) by assigning them to the return of bet(...)
    ~fixed a buggy else condition (line 88) which allowed for infinte looping

    leave(...) > removed leave from multiple places and added it a 3 specific states (After exting bet(...) from either state, exiting the program from the main(...))

    deposit(...) > updated the function arguements by removing unecessary variables (due to other chnages)
    ~fixed a bug when updating the current condition where it was assigned to the wrong value (added +=, line 107)
    ~added a print statement displaying the new balance 
    ~included that the function returns the input arguments to fix the updating issue
    
    main(...) > updated the variables of main(...) by assigning them to the return of play(...)
    ~~included that the function returns the leave(...) function to display the results of the session


Need to do:
    >change the inputs and logic of lines(...) to add significance to the wager amount (useless as of now)
    >change balance, bet, betting result (and other?) variables to floats to account for all rational numbers > 0
    >import time to add sleep() functionally to increase realism within simulation
